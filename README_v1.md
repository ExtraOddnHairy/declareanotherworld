The top level holder for all that comes next.
<br>This is Readme_v1. I will not delete anything in the readme files, ever. I will only create a new version of the readme. 
<br>
<br>Introduction - Purpose
<br>My goal with this project are multiple - to document my process as I go, and to demonstrate that we live in an incredible time, now is different than ever before, and that one person with the right questions can generate a snowball, so to speak. 
To be as succinct as possible, I believe we are on the cusp of a nearly impossible change in human society. AI has greatly accelerated this perception, but it is something I have felt for quite some time regarding the communication power of the internet to mobilize human beings around basic questions of fairness, what we have in common, fundamentally, re-defining the priorities of the human experiment. At the most basic level, my grievance with the world as it is boils down to a single charge: in a planet of absolute richness and abundance, life is far too expensive for far too many. At a later point, I will elaborate my analysis. What matters now is to say I believe in a Just Consensus: a new compact that can work for all strata of society. All creeds, all strata, all religions. And that not only does a single basic operating system for business and politics exist that will be acceptable to ALL, but that technologically, we have the means to implement this operating system by peaceful means, on the basis of suggestion alone. Yes, these are giant, fantastical claims. Perhaps a waste of your time, so alien to the world we live in, so as to appear as mere noise. I would like to make the most of whatever remaining seconds I have of your attention to try to persuade you to give these writings a fair chance.

<br>WhoAmI?
<br>This is one of the harder questions I have grappled with for several years. While I have thought about these big picture ideas since I was a teenager in the 90s, I have always resisted being in the spotlight, at the center of attention, or wanting my name out in public in any capacity. This effort on Github represents the first effort to put any of my thinking online. To that end, I am using a penname. It is: Frank Paco Jones. Frank because it is an abbreviation of Francis, one of a few spiritual guides I seek inspiration from in the choices he made in life. Also, Frank means candor, honesty, speaking plainly. Paco because I like that name, and it was Frank Serpico's nickname, and it's a nod to my latin, immigrant roots. Jones because it is an everyman name here in the USA, my adoptive homeland. It is perhaps inevitable that my real name will be doxxed if/when this project earns any interest whatsoever, as I am no genius hacker able to maintain a presence while being truly anonymous. At that point, I will have to deal with a spotlight of some kind. If I succeed in my effort however, I personally will not be integral to the desired outcome of this project.
<br>
<br>Reading over the above, I have succeeded in not telling you much that matters, so to fix that, I should probably state a few facts about me that will serve to answer maybe some basic questions, while also preserving a bit of privacy and therefore sanity. I am a middle aged agnostic male, a resident and citizen of the USA, and my net worth is not remarkable. I am not a published author. I havenâ€™t written anything outside of work or school contexts, besides an occasional email blast to friends or a facebook diatribe that stays among a handful of people.
I am unedited. This represents the workings of a single mind, for better or worse. There is ZERO use of AI in these writings. Any future use of AI will be specifically marked, and used within a specific context, for a specific purpose. As I said earlier, I have been thinking about these topics for quite a while. While focussing on the same set of themes and questions for many years provides me with a degree of perspective, it is also blinding, and ultimately, suffocating. I expect to be attacked, given the grandiosity of these writings. But since I have carried these ideas with me for many years and have reached the breaking point of gestation, I must release it all, consequences be damned. I am at the limit of what I can carry, the time has come to commit these ideas to a written form and walk away from them, gain some distance. I will elaborate as time allows, as these doodles are a hobby, I do not live by my ideas, but I'd like to change that. I work in the arts by trade.

<br>Hello World, a Declaration of Sorts: Meta Consensus, No Villains, Deep Trust, and more
<br>TBC.
