The top level holder for all that comes next.
<br>This is Readme_v1. I will not delete anything in the readme files, ever. I will only create a new version of the readme.

<br>Introduction - Purpose
<br>My goal with this project are multiple - to document my process as I go, and to demonstrate that we live in an incredible time, now is different than ever before, and that one person with the right questions can generate a snowball, so to speak. 
To be as succinct as possible, I believe we are on the cusp of a nearly impossible change in human society. AI has greatly accelerated this perception, but it is something I have felt for quite some time regarding the communication power of the internet to mobilize human beings around basic questions of fairness, what we have in common, fundamentally, re-defining the priorities of the human experiment. At the most basic level, my grievance with the world as it is boils down to a single charge: in a planet of absolute richness and abundance, life is far too expensive for far too many. At a later point, I will elaborate my analysis. What matters now is to say I believe in a Just Consensus: a new compact that can work for all strata of society. All creeds, all strata, all religions. And that not only does a single basic operating system for business and politics exist that will be acceptable to ALL, but that technologically, we have the means to implement this operating system by peaceful means, on the basis of suggestion alone. Yes these are giant, fantastical claims. Perhaps a waste of your time, so unlike the world we live in, as to be mere noise. I would like to make the most of whatever remaining seconds I have of your attention to try to persuade you to believe me.

<br>Introduction - WhoAmI  
<br>This is one of the harder questions I have grappled with for several years. While I have thought about these big picture ideas, I have always resisted being in the spotlight, at the center of attention, or wanting my name out in public in any capacity. To that end, I am using a penname. It is Frank Paco Jones. Frank because it is an abbreviation of Francis, one of a few spiritual guides I seek inspiration from in the choices he made in life. Also, Frank means candor, honesty, speaking plainly. Paco because I like that name, and it was Frank Serpico's nickname, and it's a nod to my latin, immigrant roots. Jones because it is an everyman name here in the USA, my adoptive homeland. It is perhaps inevitable that my real name will be doxxed if/when this project earns any interest whatsoever, as I am no genius hacker able to maintain a presence while being truly anonymous. At that point, I will have to deal with a spotlight of some kind. If I succeed in my effort however, I personally will not be integral to the desired outcome of this project.
<br>
<br>I should probably state a few facts about me that will serve to answer maybe some basic questions. I am a middle aged agnostic male, a resident and citizen of the USA, and my net worth is not remarkable.
